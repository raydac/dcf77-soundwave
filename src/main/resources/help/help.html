<h1>DCF77 Signal Generator</h1>

<p>
    This application is designed to emulate the DCF77 time signal by generating it in the audible frequency range. It
    allows you to synchronize radio-controlled wristwatches using your computer's audio system.
</p>

<p>
    DCF77 is a longwave time signal broadcast from Germany, commonly used by radio-controlled clocks and watches to
    maintain precise time. This tool makes it possible to simulate that signal locally without needing to receive it
    over the air.
</p>

<h2>Step-by-Step Instructions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Select the audio output device:</strong>
        Open your systemâ€™s sound settings and make sure your computer is configured to use headphones or a similar audio
        output device. This will be the channel used to transmit the simulated signal.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Configure the signal:</strong>
        In the application interface, choose the desired signal waveform (e.g., square or sine wave), set the modulation
        frequency, and select the appropriate carrier frequency for the DCF77 signal emulation.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Position your watch:</strong>
        Place the radio-controlled wristwatch directly onto the headphones. Make sure the back of the watch is in
        contact with the speaker membrane, as the audio signal will act as a magnetic field transmitter.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Start signal generation:</strong>
        Press the <em>Play</em> button in the application to begin generating the DCF77 signal.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Wait for synchronization:</strong>
        Allow the signal to play continuously. Synchronization may take some time depending on the model and sensitivity
        of the watch. Typically, the process takes between 5 and 15 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Confirm synchronization:</strong>
        Once the watch has received the signal, it should automatically adjust its time to the correct value. You may
        notice the hands moving or the digital display updating.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    Please note that successful synchronization depends on various factors including watch model, signal quality, volume
    level, and how well the watch is positioned on the audio source. Experiment with these variables if the
    synchronization does not occur on the first attempt.
